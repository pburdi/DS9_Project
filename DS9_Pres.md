What is NICS and Why is it important?
========================================================

- NICS is the National Instant Criminal Background Check System used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to instantly determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives.  

- It is important for US citizens because it helps keep lawful gun owners safer from scrutiny and prevents "over the counter" sales of firearms and explosives to potential criminals.


What is the NICS Tracker?

The NICS Tracker is a Shiny App and uses the the modified code structure (UI.R and Server.R) of the censusVis Shiny App to display completely new data from the FBI NICS reports modified with population predictions.

The data used for population prediction and NICS reports in the Shiny Application is found at:
